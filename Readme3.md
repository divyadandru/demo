## Method 3
If gactions does not have the "update" and "test" commands, instead has "push" and "deploy": then build actions.json via yaml structure

## Resources
1. [Build Actions for Google Assistant using Actions SDK (Level 1)](https://developers.google.com/codelabs/actions-sdk-1#0)

1. [Build Actions for Google Assistant using Actions SDK (Level 2)](https://developers.google.com/codelabs/actions-sdk-2#0)

1. [gactions CLI](https://developers.google.com/assistant/actionssdk/gactions)


NOTE: 

* Also, in case of yaml method, if we do "gactions init" in the project directory terminal, we will get a list of sample projects, which can be accessed for reference, example 
  ```bash
  gactions init interactive-canvas --dest interactive-canvas-sample
  ```
* Cloud permission is necessary.


## Steps

1. Create a new project in actions console.

1. Complete [Device registration](https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/guides/service/python)

1. In the project directory, copy paste the "sdk" folder from the Method3 (Or manually build the sdk by following the steps in [tutorial 1](https://developers.google.com/codelabs/actions-sdk-1#0), followed by steps in [tutorial 2](https://developers.google.com/codelabs/actions-sdk-2#0)

1. At the start of index.js can use either,
   ```bash
   const { actionssdk } = require('actions-on-google');
   const functions = require('firebase-functions');
   
   const app = actionssdk({ debug: true});
   ```
   or

   ```bash
   const { conversation } = require('@assistant/conversation');
   const functions = require('firebase-functions');

   const app = conversation({debug: true});
   ```
1. To test your Action in the simulator, follow these steps: 

   In the terminal, run the following command:
   ```bash
   gactions deploy preview
   ```
   
   You should receive output that looks like the following:
   ```bash
   ✔ Done. You can now test your changes in Simulator with this URL: http://console.actions.google.com/project/{project-id}/simulator?disableAutoPreview
   ```
   
   Copy the provided URL and paste it into a browser.
   
   To test your Action in the simulator, type Talk to my test app in the Input field and press Enter.

   However, this is only test view generated by link, you cannot test directly from actions console UI. This is because changes have not yet been pushed to the actions console project(you would not be able to see the intents/actions in actions console UI), hence it would be empty.
   
1. To push your Actions project and view it in the Actions console, follow these steps:

   In the terminal, run the following command to push your project to the Actions console:
   ```bash
   gactions push
   ```
   
   You should receive output that looks like the following:
   ```bash
   ✔ Done. Files were pushed to Actions Console, and you can now view your project with this URL: https://console.actions.google.com/project/{project-id}/overview. If you want to test your changes, run "gactions deploy preview", or navigate to the Test section in the Console.
   ```
   
1. Now you can directly test from the actions console. Go to Test, Give command "talk to my test app" or "talk to invocation name"

1. Give other commands according to training phrases in each intent to test the respective intents.
